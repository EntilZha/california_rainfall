    "_Water flowing over the damaged Oroville Dam Spillway. Image source:_ [William Croyle, California Department of Water Resources](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Oroville_dam_spillway_2017-02-11.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of California receives most of its annual rainfall during the winter months when storms fueled by moisture from the tropical Pacific impact the state. This past winter was the wettest on record for northern California, resulting in massive floods and over 1 billion dollars in damage. Storm runoff into Lake Oroville led to extensive releases of water along the Oroville Dam spillway. The main spillway was damaged during the releases but continued to be used due to the high volume of water. The emergency spillway then had to be used, which prompted fears of containment failure and led to large evacuations downstream of the dam. The cost to repair the spillway is estimated at 400 million dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the flooding problems associated with dams in northern California could be managed better with more accurate seasonal and subseasonal forecasts of rainfall. If water managers had a skilled forecast of expected rainfall, then they could change the distribution of water in northern California to be more resilient to large rainfall events. The mitigation process can take weeks to complete, so seasonal forecast leadtimes are needed for effective mitigation. Current operational seasonal precipitation guidance from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center has no skill above climatology for northern California and is not presented in a way that is useful for water managers at the California Department of Water Resources. Current seasonal precipitation forecasting relies primarilly on teleconnection indices, such as ENSO. However, these indices individually are poorly correlated with northern California winter rainfall. For example, the \"Godzilla\" El Nino of 2015-2016 was expected to bring very heavy rain to California but no extreme rains appeared in the winter of 2015-16. Last years heavy rains happened when ENSO was closer to a neutral state. Other teleconnections should also have some correlation with California rainfall, but finding the most important connections and how they interact is not a task that can be easily done manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for the 2017 Climate Informatics Hackathon is to use the November-averaged atmospheric fields to predict the probability of at least 750 mm of rain in northern California between December and February. The observational record for northern California rainfall only goes back to the early 1920s, which would provide a very limited sample size for machine learning or statistical models. Therefore, we are going to use climate model output from simulations run over the last 1000 years. By using climate model output, we hope to sample better the range of possible combinations of weather patterns and rainfall and fit more complex ML and statistical models.\n",

    "## NCAR Last Millennium Ensemble\n",
    "The [NCAR Last Millennium Ensemble](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/community-projects/LME/) is a set of CESM climate model runs starting in 850 AD and run through 2005. The 850 to 1850 period covers preindustrial conditions and 1850-2005 covers the industrial era. This hackathon uses the 12 full forcing ensemble members, which use the same forcings but had their initial air temperature fields perturbed by a small random roundoff of $10^{-14}$C. The ensemble members thus capture the internal variability within the model's climate system. More information about the Last Millennium Ensemble can be found in its [BAMS paper](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/community-projects/LME/publications/Otto-Bliesner_BAMS-LME_2016-2.pdf).\n",

    "## Submitting to [ramp.studio](http://ramp.studio)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you found a good model, you can submit it to [ramp.studio](http://www.ramp.studio). First, if it is your first time using RAMP, [sign up](http://www.ramp.studio/sign_up), otherwise [log in](http://www.ramp.studio/login). Then find an open event on the particular problem, for example, the event [california_rainfall](https://www.ramp.studio/events/california_rainfall) for this RAMP. Sign up for the event. Both signups are controled by RAMP administrators, so there **can be a delay between asking for signup and being able to submit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your signup request is accepted, you can go to your [sandbox](http://www.ramp.studio/events/california_rainfall/sandbox) and copy-paste (or upload) [`feature_extractor.py`](/edit/submissions/starting_kit/feature_extractor.py) and [`classifier.py`](/edit/submissions/starting_kit/classifier.py) from `submissions/starting_kit`. Save it, rename it, then submit it. The submission is trained and tested on our backend in the same way as `ramp_test_submission` does it locally. While your submission is waiting in the queue and being trained, you can find it in the \"New submissions (pending training)\" table in [my submissions](http://www.ramp.studio/events/california_rainfall/my_submissions). Once it is trained, you get a mail, and your submission shows up on the [public leaderboard](http://www.ramp.studio/events/california_rainfall/leaderboard). \n",
    "If there is an error (despite having tested your submission locally with `ramp_test_submission`), it will show up in the \"Failed submissions\" table in [my submissions](http://www.ramp.studio/events/california_rainfall/my_submissions). You can click on the error to see part of the trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "After submission, do not forget to give credits to the previous submissions you reused or integrated into your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set we use at the backend is usually different from what you find in the starting kit, so the score may be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual way to work with RAMP is to explore solutions, add feature transformations, select models, perhaps do some AutoML/hyperopt, etc., _locally_, and checking them with `ramp_test_submission`. The script prints mean cross-validation scores \n",

When the score is good enough, you can submit it at the RAMP."
